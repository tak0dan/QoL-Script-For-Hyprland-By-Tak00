# Tak0-hypr-per-window-switch
A little script for hypland for the per-window keybord layout switching.


So basically you just link this script to the keybind that will be responsible for the layout switching. 
In different cases it can not work because of the missing directory. In this case just run script manually and check for missing directory or file output and create it.
